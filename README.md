# Tranformation_and_Projections
This is the second project of my Computer Graphics university Course .Transformation and Projections

Given an image as a set of triangles, each triangle being a 3 vetrice, and their colors, group, the code calculates the projection of the image in the camera's lens. This is 
achieved using affine transformations.
